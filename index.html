<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="p1"><font size=-1 face="verdana">My name is Saurabh Jain and I am a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL Inc.</a> I work on Android platforms like Android Mobile devices,
Android TV & VR with an interest of expanding it to Android Auto and Wear. More on my skills <a href="http://saurabhjain.net/Resume%20-%20Saurabh%20Jain.pdf">here</a> (<a href="http://saurabhjain.net/Resume%20-%20Saurabh%20Jain.docx">doc-version here</a>). Few years ago I used to write a <a href="http://saurabhjain12.blogspot.com/">blog</a>
on different concepts from Android Documentation which I found worth reading. Since then I have always believed in reading platform documentation regularly to keep myself upto date with the latest trends in the industry.
Of late I have had opportunity to be a part of several tech conferences like Google I/O, Facebook F8 and Twitter Flight which I found to be very insightful.
When I am not working I am either exploring different cities of the world or killing it at ping pong.</font></p>

<h2>Story So Far</h2>
<p><font size=-1 face="verdana">I grew up in New Delhi, India where I also went to my high school <a href="http://summerfields.co.in/">Summer Fields</a> and completed BS in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.mdurohtak.ac.in/">MDU</a>.
In an aspiration to get my graduate degree thereafter, I went to <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a> and graduated with MS in Computer Science in 2011 from <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/">Viterbi School of Engineering</a>. Soon after I joined AOL Inc. where I have been part of
various product development teams over the past few years.</font></p>
